The main city centre areas are all in Zone 1 along with Barcelona Airport.

    - Barcelona Metro;

    - FGC;

    - TMB buses; 

    - the main tram;

    -  the RENFE train to and from Barcelona main airport (El Prat de Llobregat).

    (2) For a one day card the Barcelona card is valid until 00:00 Midnight of the day on which you activate the card. It is important to note that if you activate the Barcelona card late in the day then you may only have a few hours of use. If you purchased a three day card then the card will be valid until 00:00 Midnight on the third day after the day of activation. It is therefore important when you activate your Barcelona card. This limitation does not apply to the T10 ticket.
